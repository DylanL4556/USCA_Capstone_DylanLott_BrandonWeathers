# Welcome to Our 2025-26 USCA Capstone Project
Advisor: Dr. Yilian Zhang

Students: Dylan Lott & Brandon Weathers
## Project Description 
Modern technology allows the protection of sensitive information.​ Naturally, the presence of value leads to people with malicious intent.​ Currently, the file EPSB contains methods used to calculate the CR for a given set of passwords that all belong to a single user. This is a college project and is not intended for serious use.
<br>
<br>
**Our Research Goal:**
<br>
Develop an algorithm to detect malicious users using various metrics including the longest common substring for multiple strings algorithm.​
## How to Run
1. git fork https://github.com/BrandonWeathers000/USCA_Capstone_DylanLott_BrandonWeathers.git
2. cd /USCA_Capstone_DylanLott_BrandonWeathers 
3. javac *.java
4. java EPSB_Parser
5. When prompted, input the database which you wish to analyse.
6. When prompted, input the user number you wish to analyse.
7. After you are finished viewing desired info, press any key to continue.
8. If you want to continue querying, return to step 5.

## Runing Longest Common Substring
This program takes the first two entries from database Synthetic30000PwPairsV2.csv and compares them.
The testing instructions are as follows.
1. git fork https://github.com/BrandonWeathers000/USCA_Capstone_DylanLott_BrandonWeathers.git
2. cd /USCA_Capstone_DylanLott_BrandonWeathers/LCSM
3. javac *.java
4. java LCSM

## How to Test the Algirhtm's Speed on Different Machines
I relised that on some machines the different algorithms dont' scale quite right.
The following instructions only work on Linux and MacOS (actualy I'm not sure about MacOS).
- Windows users can manualy run each file which has Testing at the end of its name.
- They are located in their respective directories.
1. git fork https://github.com/BrandonWeathers000/USCA_Capstone_DylanLott_BrandonWeathers.git
2. cd /USCA_Capstone_DylanLott_BrandonWeathers/
3. ./TestingScript.sh
