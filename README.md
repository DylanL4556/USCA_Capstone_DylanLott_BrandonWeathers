## Project Description 
Modern technology allows the protection of sensitive information.​ Naturally, the presence of value leads to people with malicious intent.​ Currently, the file EPSB contains methods used to calculate the CR for a given set of passwords that all belong to a single user. This is a college project and is not intended for serious use.

**Our Research Goal:**
<br>
Develop an algorithm to detect malicious users using various metrics including the longest common substring for multiple strings algorithm.​
