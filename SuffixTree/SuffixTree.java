// This class is used to create, modify and access suffix trees.

// According to Ukkonen's algorithm a suffix tree can be constructed in Θ(N) time, where N represents the length of the tree.

//
// According to Wikipedia, you can use a suffix tree to solve the longest common substring problem in Θ(N) time.

// An example implementation can be found here.
